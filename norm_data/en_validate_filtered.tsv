Will leave its mark for those with no desire
Stand in front of the whole creation
Face the people starved like worms

From the ones who rule us all
In this field the dying embers soil
All around we mourn
Oh, here they come again
The stars can't find the purple sky
Long for the day be back someday
And the church
Don't let us die
Let me rest in peace
Sanity brings up the sadness
that keeps your illusions locked in a little box
Fright comes, you find yourself lonely
in a cage of conclusions crowding your mind
You sit back bowing your head
Every answer - yes
Why don't you trust me and shed out your fears,
Running over the tears you've contained
now cover up your eyes
- Is it good for you?
And I'll be here when fire burns
(Inside your heart)
Climb up the hills and mountains,
don't forget what you've learned!
Life makes us feel the time we cannot hold
Time makes us live a tale already told
Time makes us heal a feeling inside
a feeling that lies in our heart
that we stole away...
Time after time
Burned your wings on the sun
Metal Icarus
Night after night
Up on forced unknown
Metal Icarus
Ah! Those were the years
I can still feel the windy heights
Against my skin
And if I close my eyes
I'm flying over hills!
Still stare at my face
But lost seem your eyes
Keep hold of the sails
Against the blue sky
Ooh, I'm intending
A way back to the sea
This emptiness burns inside
And leads on for endless miles
Don't let me go
Away across the sea,
The waves can't be as high
As they pretend to be
And now I know
In my heart, I won't forget
The sails against the blue sky
That taught me how to live
Hear the whispers of your hope
The answer wasn't told
No, don't laugh seeing me cry
The end I've left behind
Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting, life's been wasted
And I've tried,
Maybe you deny
Words of peace
For the future of our lives
Bring to me
Something else than a broken heart
I won't wait 'till my life is wasted
Maybe I wanna die some other day
Somehow I turn around and see
My nerves break down inside
Maybe you might know much more than me
So tell me what is right to say
Down the weakness of my soul
Lie the secrets, and I know
There's something pushing back
Wish my hands could turn to gold
And my heart would break the cold
To give my thoughts some sense
Under the sun
In a solitary world
I am running alone
Scars on my face
Weary hands from digging dirt
I was dying all alone
Am I running?
Where am I?
Where has everyone gone this time?
Left my future far behind
I am nothing but the sole survivor"	Metal

So I came in here
And your long time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear that I just can't fit
Yes I believe it's for us to quit
When we meet again introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when

I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.
She took off her wheel, took off her bell,
Took off her wig, said, ""How do I smell?""
I hot-footed it 

bare-naked 
.
Out the window!
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.
Don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
(Right there
Proud as can be)
I's out there paintin' on the old woodshed
When a can a black paint it fell on my head.
I went down to scrub and rub
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
(Cost a quarter
And I had to get out quick 
.
Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna)
Well, my telephone rang it would not stop,
It's President Kennedy callin' me up.
He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?""
I said, ""My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.""
(Put 'em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!)
Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot,
She yells and hollers and squeals a lot.
Licks my face and tickles my ear,
Bends me over and buys me beer.
(She's a honeymooner
A June crooner
A spoon feeder
And a natural leader)
Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' so heavy,
I got a woman who works on the levee.
Pumping that water up to her neck,
Every week she sends me a monthly check.
(She's a humdinger
Folk singer
Dead ringer
For a thing-a-muh jigger)
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Eyes were closed I was half asleep.
I chased me a woman up the hill,
Right in the middle of an air raid drill.
It was Little Bo Peep!
(I jumped a fallout shelter
I jumped a bean stalk
I jumped a ferris wheel)
Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note.
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,
Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people.
(He's eatin' bagels
He's eatin' pizza
He's eatin' chitlins
He's eatin' bullshit!)
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Out of the shower comes a grown-up man
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand.
(It's that greasy kid stuff.
What I want to know, Mr
Football Man, is
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,
Charles de Gaulle
And Robert Louis Stevenson?)
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr
Clean.
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.
(She's a little bit heavy!)
Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time,
It levels my head and eases my mind.
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
I see better days and I do better things.

I make love to Elizabeth Taylor

Catch hell from Richard Burton!)."	Rock

I’d surely like to rest
But the energy gets the best of me
It’s been a wild ride
I wouldn’t change a minute
I can’t slow down inside
Guess that’s why I live it
Watch it now!
The years of mischief
Followed by weeks of thrift
I land on earth’s hard face
No legs could keep this pace
And through the rest I sift
Is there ever a time?
When the state of sleeping willingly leaves my mind
Highly frustrated wanna feel elated
Come monday morn you fell checkmated
You can be uncool and become the rule
Exceptions were made to drown
I’m not used to it, you’d think I’d be by now
The ins the outs the ups and the downs
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
It comes and goes and comes and goes
Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do
I know what you we’re gonna say
But were afraid to cause dismay
You’re lyrics switched around
The mixture watered down
And now a pointless display
It’s something one won’t understand
Unless there in it with me hand and hand
Don’t buy the fear don’t buy that my dear
The things you love you must keep near and
Carry on and you won’t feel withdrawn
Even if you’re coming down
Sometimes it’s wearable sometimes is bearable
I careen towards balance til’ the glass is full
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
It comes and goes and comes and goes
Sometimes
Sometimes I get a little out there
Sometimes I go off
Sometimes just like you
Watch it now!

Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do
Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do."	Rock

It was a group in automation getting together two by two
Where people live and love one another, people who live like me and you
Then on the beach in warm Miami there was a teacher far from school
Taught him the way to please a woman, made him concede the Golden Rule
He learned to do it unto others as he used to just have them do
So they began to come together as I will try to do with you
And there was one who was a virgin, never been touched by anyone
She was as pure as any angel, in fact she's called to be a nun
But it was all because my buddy just couldn't spoil a girl so true
And so he left her as he found her, like I may have to do with you
The girl he's got now, he's never left her, she was the first I thought he'd shun
Until I saw my buddy's eyes, when she came forth and bore his son
Since then he's known no other woman, I think his ramblin' days are through
They built a home up in the country, a life I'd love to build with you
Although you've never known my buddy and I am sure he don't know you
But you know the life he's living and all of the changes he's been through
Sweetheart, I'm talking about my buddy 'cause I don't want to wind up blue
I could be happy with you only 'cause I see all of them in you

thinking that they've got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts

you better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags
and the language that he used
Go to him, he calls you,
you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing,
you got nothing to lose

Gave up their rusty guns and went back home

And Marshall law was passed
Riverboat gamblers put their money on faith
For the time for hope had passed
In the cold blue light of the desert night

And men came down from still I don't know where
With death on their fingertips

I see you standin, across the room watchin' me without a sound
I'm gonna push my way through that crowd
I'm gonna tear your holy walls down
Tear all your walls down

6229	en	"Someone's got it in for me,
they're planting stories in the press
Whoever it is
I wish they'd cut it out
but when they will I can only guess.
They say I shot a man named Gray
and took his wife to Italy,
She inherited a million bucks
and when she died it came to me.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
People see me all the time
and they just can't remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas,
images and distorted facts.
Even you, yesterday
you had to ask me where it was at,
I couldn't believe
after all these years,
you didn't know me better than that
Sweet lady.
Idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your mouth,
Blowing down the backroads headin' south.
Idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe.
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
I ran into the fortune-teller,
who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long
I can't remember what it's like.
There's a lone soldier on the cross
smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door
You didn't know it,
you didn't think it could be done,
in the final end he won the wars
After losin' every battle.
I woke up on the roadside,
daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare
shoot through my head
and are makin' me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best
and cover up the truth with lies.
One day you'll be in the ditch,
flies buzzin' around your eyes,
Blood on your saddle.
Idiot wind,
blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Blowing through the curtains in your room.
Idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe.
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
It was gravity which pulled us down
and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage
but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.
Now everything's a little upside down,
as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped,
What's good is bad, what's bad is good,
you'll find out when you reach the top
You're on the bottom.
I noticed at the ceremony,
your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can't remember your face anymore,
your mouth has changed
your eyes don't look into mine.
The priest wore black on the seventh day
and sat stone-faced while
the building burned.
I waited for you on the running boards,
near the cypress trees,
while the springtime turned Slowly into autumn.
Idiot wind,
blowing like a circle around my skull,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.
Idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe.
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
I can't feel you anymore,
I can't even touch the books you've read
Every time I crawl past your door,
I been wishin' I was somebody else instead.
Down the highway, down the tracks,
down the road to ecstasy,
I followed you beneath the stars,
hounded by your memory
And all your ragin' glory.
I been double-crossed now for the very last time
and now I'm finally free,
I kissed goodbye
the howling beast on the borderline
which separated you from me.
You'll never know the hurt
I suffered nor the pain I rise above,
And I'll never know the same about you,
your holiness or your kind of love,
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Idiot wind,
blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.
Idiot wind,
blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
We're idiots, babe.
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves."	Rock

Between this callous thought and deed
And you're a sweeter way to give me

How I hope it's no dream tomorrow
But I'm scared the light will fade
And today will be a vague recollection
Just a fool's escapade, escapade
I never cared much about the future
Yesterday was always there
So when you give me hope, hope or a promise
It just isn't fair, isn't fair
Any plan, any calculation
Any plot or device at all
Runs into another's dream
Runs into a wall
No matter what premeditation

Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
And then I turn my head, for you're approachin' me.
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room
With a golden loom.
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.
And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
With your golden loom.
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.

Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row""

And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping

The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody's shouting
""Which Side Are You On?""

To destroy all their plans with no thought of me
No thought of me, no thought of me

4858	en	"I don't know since when I changed to such a cold-hearted guy
I have to warm this frozen, icy, lonely heart to thaw
I like being wrapped with warmness more than anything else for sure
I'm gonna make my coming days to be filled with laughter and joy
I let myself down that I'm more cruel than I thought I would be
I'm just a loser who ends up by caring for my soul
I don't give my heart to no one cause I don't wanna waste my time
I tried to love this loneliness to slip out of lonesome hole
Sorrow is what I hate but it's grown by sensations
Regrets tought me how to make any hard decisions
Peace is always by my side but I've never felt it once
Love is not the word only for the sweet romance
Well I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
And I'm scared to keep on going on my way
Well I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
And I'll tell myself I'm special 'till the end
Recalling my torn, broken, aching heart of these long days
And all the memories I wanted to forget for making leaps
Recalling, breaking, aching, crying, making sure to me
And I take all and grin at my future on the way
Sorrow is what I hate but it's grown by sensations
Regrets tought me how to make any hard decisions
Peace is always by my side but I've never felt it once
Love is not the word only for the sweet romance
Well I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
And I'm scared to keep on going on my way
Well I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
And I'll tell myself I'm special 'till the end...
I don't give my heart to no one cause I don't wanna waste my time
I tried to love this loneliness to slip out of lonesome hole

I found my sweet delta blues
She weaved a little southern spell on me
Made a little voodoo
She was born the bright side of midnight
When her mama was seventeen
She was a hot blooded - god fearin' - gospel girl
The finest that I ever seen
She's black coffee - little bit 'o cream
Sweet brown sugar - my midnight dream
Black pearl - my kinda girl
Just the kind of thing to rock my world
Black pearl - she's my kinda girl
Met her in a dixie diner
Put on the southern hospitality
I can still smell her sweet molasses
Running all over me
We started rollin' like the river
Like a twister tearin' through the town
Tongue tied - satisfied - 'n southern fried
As she drove this ol' dixie down
She's black coffee - little bit 'o cream
Sweet brown sugar - my midnight dream
Black pearl - my kinda girl
Just the kind of thing to rock my world
Black pearl - she's my kinda girl
Yeah she's alright - yeah she's ok
Makin' love night - she really made my day."	Rock

I'm breaking out my six string
And playing from my heart
It's not deja vu
Cause it's another summer
That's how this chapter starts
I'm gonna run so fast till I can't breathe
Come along and follow me
Let's make some noise we never did before
It's a brand new day
Don't you see me
Changing up my way
So completely
This time I'm gonna sing, everybody hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day, and I'm feeling good
And I'm feeling good
So drama free
I'm all about the music I just wanna sing
Watch me leave out my dreams
I'm gonna rock that stage and get my everything
I'm gonna dance until my feet can't move
Come along get in the groove
Let's shine so bright what can we did before
It's a brand new day
Don't you see me?
Changing up my way
So completely
This time I'm gonna sing, everybody hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day, and I'm feeling good

I'm gonna laugh through the summer with you.
(who you are gonna be? who you are gonna be?)
You'll just have to watch me carefully
(Where you wanna go? where you wanna go?)
Anywhere my heart wants me to go
I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna dance
I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna play
I'm gonna try my hand in everything

There's nothing wrong with your TV set
We're a gettin loose
We couldn't be harder
Our beats are bigger and better and longer
Got real rock shit
You must admit
Not fake, not false, not counterfit
I can play the drums, I can play gituar
Not just b-boys, but real rock stars
Rock, rock rock...
When we borrow your shit, you better hit the deck
You'll walk the plank for your dis
Respect, respect, respect...
If you front on the Rock, best run and hide
If you got static, we'll take it outside
And you start to get dulled by the Beastie Boys
Use real rock beats, show off big toys
Like claps of thunder from the cumulus clouds
So we'll pump up the beat and make it real loud
Loud...
A, then scrach it...
Heavy metal tension running through your blood
Too much rock step off the pud
Too much treble mid-range and bass
The beat's so hard it'll dick your face
You'll crush out hard rock hard beats hard
Rock cold rythms for fanitic freaks
Some people say this has been done
We're hear we're now
And the battles won
Fists...
Fists of fury in an MC bout
Rock so hard it'll knock you out
The very first blow is a kick in the snout
The beat's so def that you better beware
When you're talkin' bass right in your face
The walls crumble down, destroying the place
The finishing touch is the bokasat-slam
The final blow in the five finger jam
Some...
Sometimes I write rythms rather write rhymes
He writes his and I write mine
Rock 'n roll rythms are raunchy and ronkis
We're from Manhatten, you're from Secaucus

In a way these boys got juice
They're goin' off you know they love to get loose
Get loose get loose...

Slop one, slop one
And your goin' the boots

Every time I think I got it figured
Something bigger always jumps in the frame
Something gets in the way
Now I? m ready to turn the page on yesterdays and forgive them
Now I? m willing to disengage to seize the day and move on
Wanna swing you higher
Wanna swing you higher
Vibration, coming up from the ground
Translation, something just more than sound
When I move on to the next world
I? ll wait for you over there
Rotation, my head the other way around

He was a bouncer in a joint called Tony's Body Shop
She was a night cashier down at the Stop 'n' Shop
He was kinda good-lookin'
And she was kinda fun
They met 'neath that big oak tree
Out where the river runs
Little Angelyne, little Angelyne
As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
Just Big Bill and little Angelyne
She was just in from Texas, didn't know her way around
So he took her to a roadhouse on the edge of town
In the beerhall light she looked so fine
And so he popped the question that was on his mind
It was a simple affair, only a friend or two
Preacher asked if they did, they said they do
She bought two tickets with her Daddy's American Express
And hopped a greyhound bus in her wedding dress
Little Angelyne, little Angelyne
As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
Just Big Bill and little Angelyne
In a six dollar motel with the honey bun
With seven glorious days in the Nevada sun
He played the tables, she pumped the slots full of dimes
They came back broke but they had a good time
Now many fell apart in the years come and gone
But Big Bill and little Angel they'd last on and on
They held together when the times grew thin
A little boy that looked like her, and a girl that looked like him
So mister don't you pay it no mind
Let the sun go down and the moonlight shine
Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
Just Big Bill and little Angelyne
Little Angelyne, little Angelyne
As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
Just Big Bill and little Angelyne
Little Angelyne, little Angelyne
As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined

There's one on is arm in every land that he roams
And two consecutive nights alone

Stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
So why you can't win?
And the first and the last
Are two things you'll never be my darling
Another run around and another push and shove
Further awake from the idea of a love
And this conclusion it must be good
Or when the penny had dropped with an incredible Thud
Forgot to kick the tin
He knows where she's going
But don't know where she's been
And there's the plus of the other thing
He'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in

Turned blue and you're struggling just to see
You were too far gone to carry on, now your life
Has stalled
As you march ahead yet go no place at all
Pilgrim, when you left them all behind the
Loneliness destroyed your able mind
Pilgrim, see the writing on the door? It's taking
You back to a place you were before
And the next in line paces your stride waiting for your fall
With a hope that lies in a hidden master's call
Pious eyes ignoring passers by
Headlong to their grave
Don't despair this world of toil and care
This

Pilgrim will you ever find your call? Is truth so
Pure that you're willing to risk it all?

Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress, she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again

But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely

A photograph
A low life laugh

In the shadow of a fever pitch

A heart stained in hate, a feeling I fear will play circles

But you, you were my favorite
But you, you know, you were my favorite

I've severed my ties to shroud this body under the streets of this city
And wait for the day when I am summoned to walk across the face
Well slowly but clearer now in visions that play and plague memories
I love them with all as a son should to mother and father

But you, you were my favorite
But you, you know, you were my favorite

Would I walk through the door
Shedding the light of all life?
With the rise and reform
Would I come as before?

Pray you're not the only one
Pray you're not the only

If given mistakes would I take them back?
If erasing them could
If erasing them would

But would they be the words that I would say?
Your face and a door between
I've parted three ways
For you, the Newo that I loved

Did you ever really know before, my face shamed to break?
Did you ever really know before, my mind scared to think?
Did you ever really know before, my name son to these?
Did you, did you, did you come clean, in the end from the start?

I fought the decisions that called and lost
My mark has a relevant piece in this
I will come reformed

I bless the hour that holds your fall
I will kill you all

Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy
From God our heav'nly Father a blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same;
How that in Bethlehem was born the son of God by name.
""Fear not, then,"" said the angel, ""Let nothing you afright
This day is born a Savior of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him from Satan's power and might.""
The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind,
And went to Bethl'em straightaway this blessed Babe to find.
But when to Bethlehem they came whereat this Infant lay,
They found Him in a manger where oxen feed on hay;
His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray.
Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface.
God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign,
And many a merry Christmas may live to see again;
Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near--

You've got to measure up
And make me prouder
How long before you screw it up
How many times do I have to tell you to hurry up
With everything I do for you
The least you can do is keep quiet
Be a good girl
You've gotta try a little harder
That simply wasn't good enough
To make us proud
I'll live through you
I'll make you what I never was
If you're the best, then maybe so am I

You'll make up for what I blew

Never, never, never say die again

Monday's home and dry
Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go
Hold back, 'till it's ready, taking it slow
Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?

Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again
Don't you ever say die
Don't you ever say die
Never say die

Children get together, you can save us all
Future's on the corner, throwing us a die
Slow down, turn around, everything's fine
There's no need to have a reason
There's no need to wonder why
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

He said ""Them big boys did what Hitler couldn’t do.""
These mills they built the tanks and bombs
That won this country’s wars
We sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam
Now we’re wondering what they were dyin’ for
Here in Youngstown

My sweet Jenny I’m sinkin’ down
Here darlin’ in Youngstown
From the Monongahela valley
To the Mesabi iron range
To the coal mines of Appalachia
The story’s always the same
Seven hundred tons of metal a day
Now sir you tell me the world’s changed
Once I made you rich enough
Rich enough to forget my name
And Youngstown
And Youngstown
My sweet Jenny I’m sinkin’ down
Here darlin’ in Youngstown

I would not do heaven’s work well
I pray the devil comes and takes me
To stand in the fiery furnaces of hell."	Rock

Canary turned into a Sabre jet
Shocked consumer - you're just an average guy
Swelling tumor pushing on your eye
And now you know why all the headaches come
And why you're getting progressively numb

Just think about it
And what's the point nothing so slight
Could ever on earth be enlightened entirely
Just think about it
Ask me, I'm not blind, I can read all the signs
So many have died, So many out of their minds
Thank your lucky stars you've got it good it's
Not hard
To be what you are, thank your lucky stars
We're in a place I thought we'd never get
People devolved and fought or they fled
But I do not know how we're goin' to get out of
It, woah
It's a mistake to be paranoid
A mental state that takes strength to avoid
All the hostility and fear should be challenged
Woah
Cuz what's the point of living that way
So many close their minds to what others say
Which ever feeling you voice
And what's the point, we're gonna pay
Sorted out one way or not we all have that day

This vulgar social pastime
Reflects the lowest mark of our progress
And the few who ride peripheral
Maintain subtle advantage
Fighting hard to abstain and redress
Do you know your place
In the big charade?
Are you more than they?

Recognition by proximity
And a brand new face

And a pinch of social grace

Or you can tell them what to do

Maintains perspective on the human play

Many turn and go the other way

Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore

When you've been where we've been
Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the sniggers?
Are they there at all, or is it just paranoia?
Everybody's got their box
Doing what they're told
You pushed my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicidal
Won't crack or compromise
Your do-rights or individes
Will never unhinge us
And there's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Yeah, long before ya
Just cos we're having a say-so
Not lining up to be playdoh
Oh, in five years time, will it be
""Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?""

I would always have to do a double, a double cuz one just ain’t enough

The sweetest repose comes in the strangest of places

He came north with his brother Luis to California three years ago
They crossed at the river Levee when Luis was just 16
And found work together in the fields of the San Joaquin
They left their friends and family
Their father said ""My sons one thing you will learn
For everything the north gives it exacts a price in return.
""They worked side by side in the orchards
From morning till the day was thru
Doing the work the hueros wouldn't
Word was out some men in from Sinaloa were looking for some hands
Well deep in Fresno county there was a deserted chicken ranch
There was a small tin shack on the edge of a ravine
Miguel and Luis stood cooking methamphetamine
You could spend a year in the orchards
Or make half as much in one ten-hour shift
Working for the men from Sinaloa
But if you slipped the Hydriodic acid
Could burn right thru your skin
They'd leave you spittin' up blood in the desert
If you breathed those fumes in
It was early one winter evening as Miguel stood watch outside
When the shack exploded lighting up the valley night
Miguel carried Luis' body over his shoulder down a swale
To the creekside and there in the tall grass Luis Rosales died
Miguel lifted Luis' body into his truck and then he drove
To where the morning sunlight fell on a eucalyptus grove
There in the dirt he dug up 10000 dollars all that they'd saved
Kissed his brother's lips and placed him in his grave."	Rock

Have turned into a conspiracy
Wash your life in mother's tears
Grieving after all disease
Tell me who gave you the right

Insanity and madness, better or for worse
Dishonesty and lies
Have turned a blessing to a curse
And in this world of sadness
It's easier to blame
Deception and denial
Shuns the burning of the flame
The path of life leads to the grave
God have mercy, Jesus save
Guide us through, now, hold on tight
Get down on your knees and cry all night
Why don't we try to find a real solution?
No need to cry, so wipe away those tears
So many times I've tried, but you won't listen
Now it's too late to save those wasted years
Mind assassination, break the golden rules
Who do you think you are?
To me, you're just another fool
You didn't to reason, you didn't even try
Only see things from your side

Rests in someone's mortal hand tonight

And every soul on Earth got to demonstrate
Their loving if we're to survive

Scared to death that our ship will sink

With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out
Like you'd never lost a war

Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap

Phony paper passing at Nix Check Cashing
Went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn House of D.
He said you behave son or we'll throw away the key
Harry Houdini'd out the cuffs I kicked the screw in the knee
Took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to O.T.B.

6655	en	"The pale moon rose Explainin it's glory
Out on the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down
T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a golden age foretold
The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home
The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love
The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld
Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap
He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn?t stand here long
He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around
The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart
Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done
The watchman lay there dreaming
At fourtyfive degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees
Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?
His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere
Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers
The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
It'd be the last trip of his life
Calvin, Blake and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale on the disembark
Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance
They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks
The bishop left his cabin
To help others in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, ""The poor are yours to feed""
Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world
Jim Dandy smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him
He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace
The battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn?t hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold
Leo said to Cleo
I think I?m going mad
But he?d lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had
He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm
Petals fell from flowers
?Til all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on
The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go
There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before
The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone
The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel
He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race
In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears
When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
On the judgement of God's hand
The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
Love had lost its fires
All things had run their course
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking

Don't know how much of this I can take,
Baby I'm under your spell.

When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Baby, oh what a story I could tell.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
I'd like to help you but I'm in a bit of a jam,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
But I will be back, I will survive,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive.
Baby, can't you tell.
Well it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
I'm starin' at your picture, I'm hearin' your words.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
Everywhere you go it's enough to break hearts
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Don't think I 'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
Baby, what more can I tell?

Pray that I don't die of thirst,

her soft eyes see through my tortured soul

I confess
I scare myself
through the howling wind, on my knees, I cry

my wingless angel so broken falls gracefully from the sky

My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in.
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string

Sometimes I just can't help myself
When my mind's running wild
I seem to lose grip on reality
And I try to disregard the crazy things
The voices tell me to do, but it's no use
I tried to own it, write songs about it
Believe me I tried
In the end I needed to breathe
Find inspiration, some kind of purpose
To take a second to face the shit
That makes me, me
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth
With myself in a cage
Banging my head against the wall
Tryna put words on a page

To sit alone in a room, alone in a room

Tried to cure the ache with absence
But that hole was still a hole
And my mind kept playing tricks on me
Feeling older every day
Took everything I had to not crash and burn
But I'm starting to learn
Sometimes I'll fall down
Sometimes I'll lose hope
But those days will be few
If I keep my feet on the ground
I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here

Everyone needs a touch
Or a shoulder for crying

They say love is blind
And that's all that she needed
But I could not supply
When a bend in the road
Put it out of my mind
There was a strange little girl
Who was everything I ever dreamed
I could love or be loved by
So put a bridge or a hill
Or a forest of pines
Or a river of blue

You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train
Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak
Sucking down pints till I didn't know
Woke up in the morning at the Won Ton Ho

Well I guessed exactly that
Because he found a special girl
That put him in a special trance
He fell in love so quickly
What the hell was he to expect
That the girl under his arm wasn't the same
As any other girl
That he had thought that he once met
I guess you could only blame fate
Things started getting weird as they started to kiss
She often felt his beard and remembered how her father she missed
And then quietly one day
He sang a song from deep within his heart
Causing some ingestion
He finished with a great big fart and
She knew at that one moment
That song was something she heard before
So she asked him to do that again
Then out the door they hurried
She was gonna find out for sure
So she analyzed his rear end
She said, ""When I was a little girl my dad left my mom.
He used to always fart and sing this special song.
Now I wasn't quite so sure until your pants did fall.

Back and fourth from what you think is right
Time could heal the things you feel tonight
So wake up
Put on a new face
Following through
With agreements made
But a feeling
You just can't name
Is taking control
Of what you do and say
Back and fourth from what you think is right
Time could heal the things you feel tonight
Roads signal decay
When you're torn between your words
You cannot be saved
This is something you own
You won't get no sympathy
Try if you want but it won't be free
From the shadows
You just can't see
Desire and need
Almost never agree"	Pop

Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it.

They talk about a life of brotherly love, show me someone who knows how to
live it

A real suicide case, but there was nothin' I could do to stop it,

The same thing I want from you today,
I would want again tomorrow.
I got a letter on a lonesome day,
It was from her ship a-sailin',
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again,
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.
Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way,
I'm sure your mind is roamin'.
I'm sure your heart is not with me,
But with the country to where you're goin'.
So take heed, take heed of the western wind,
Take heed of the stormy weather.
And yes, there's something you can send back to me,

Tryin' to burn the place down

For just one look I'd crawl across the floor

Will you write me lipstick letters
And miss me when I am gone
Wake up tangled in the sheets
Still aching for my arms
The way you move it's almost holy
Hoping you don't know you own me
All I want is all of you and more

The child is a King, the carollers sing,
The old is passed, there's a new beginning.
Dreams of Santa, dreams of snow,
Fingers numb, faces aglow.
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine,
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree,
A time to rejoice in the good that we see.
A time for living, a time for believing,
A time for trusting, not deceiving.
Love and laughter and joy ever after,
Ours for the taking, just follow the master.

Pretty baby, you look so heavenly.

Ya ya baby, ""La Dolce Vita"" is a magic dance.
No one was listening.
Pretty baby, petite ingenue, teenage starlet, I fell in love with you.
You, you with the comb..
you look ok in every way.
Ah..

Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate places
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're all alone all you do is think

That will lead me across the border
Tomorrow my love and I Will sleep 'neath auburn skies
Somewhere across the border
We'll leave behind my dear
The pain and sadness we found here
And we'll drink from the Bravo's muddy water
Where the sky grows grey and wide
We'll meet on the other side
There across the border
For you I'll build a house
High upon a grassy hill
Somewhere across the border
Where pain and memory
Pain and memory have been stilled
There across the border
And sweet blossoms fill the air
Pastures of gold and green
Roll down into cool clear waters
And in your arms 'neath open skies
I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes
There across the border
Tonight we'll sing the songs
I'll dream of you my coraz_n
And tomorrow my heart will be strong
And may the saints' blessing and grace
Carry me safely into your arms
There across the border

Without hope in our hearts
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters
And eat the fruit from the vine
I know love and fortune will be mine

With his plastic protected pockets
So his pens don't leak out upon the floor
Where Jenny's rolling
And she's scared of growing
Cause she feels five feet taller
Than the girl next door
And she wonders
Who am I?
What the hell am I?
And she's got a lot to offer
But she doesn't look like Cindy Crawford
And it makes her cry
I'm calling all

Can you hear me call tonight?
I know you're alone in your world
Full of fear though
But the more you run the harder it is to hide
It's a total rejection of the system
It's the honest opinion for the very first time
It's a different perception of living
And this child had we open our minds

His mother Mary walking beside him
In the path where his blood spilled
Jesus was an only son
In the hills of Nazareth
As he lay reading the Psalms of David
At his mother's feet
A mother prays, ""Sleep tight, my child, sleep well
For I'll be at your side
That no shadow, no darkness, no tolling bell,
Shall pierce your dreams this night""
In the garden at Gethsemane
He prayed for the life he'd never live,
He beseeched his Heavenly Father to remove
The cup of death from his lips
Now there's a loss that can never be replaced,
A destination that can never be reached
A light you'll never find in another's face,
A sea whose distance cannot be breached
Well Jesus kissed his mother's hands
Whispered, ""Mother, still your tears,
For remember the soul of the universe
Willed a world and it appeared"	Rock

The world goes racing by, my limit is the sky
Once a face in the crowd now I am facing the crowd
We are the music makers, the dreamers of dreams
Raise your glass!
Sing along to every single song
And dance around like you can almost taste the beat
Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night
And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip
When you're down I pick you up
One drink should be enough
Brothers through everything and always remembering
Where we've been and where we're going
Remember all that fear? The late nights and the tears?
Trying to do what's right while never forgetting why?
Long drives home in the sun-drenched thoughts of that first kiss
Raise your glass!
Sing along to every single song
And dance around like you can almost taste the beat
Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night
And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip
Sing along and if you're feeling reckless
Jump around like you can almost taste the beat
Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night
And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip
Give yourself to music, let it control you
Give yourself to music and it will set you free
Here's to the bold
Let's raise our glass to rock and roll
May we live fast and you die slow!
A way of life that you will never understand
My heart it lives here but my home is on the road
Over and over and over again
You dream therefore I am
Raise your glass!
Sing along to every single song
And dance around like you can almost taste the beat
Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night
And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip
Sing along and if you're feeling reckless
Jump around like you can almost taste the beat

Heartbeats and whispers in the dead of night
The sound of a hand--the touch of an eye
Visions are callin' that you can't deny

And I fall for love...
So every day I'm out on the streets tryin' to make some sense of it...
You know sometimes it feels so close that I can almost reach out...
But it always slips away...
I keep tellin' myself...""I can't stop tryin'...not ever""...

If it's the final thing I do I'm waitin' for you...

Out of nowhere, it was alright

She sits straddlin' a kitchen chair, really gung-ho
She shivers with chills, wet with her slot-card thrills
Hypnotically lost in the glass
And we all sigh with the sunrise
As we watch the credits pass
And the little blue dot went away
And then the morning cloak fell down
like a hoax over Sleepytown
Them garbage truck vigilantes out making their last rounds
The inheritor he sipped his beer
And poked fun at the queer
And threatened to kick his ass
And the bell rings, a horn blows
And he's outside pumpin' gas
But the things were movin' so slow tonight
So the kid goes back inside the station
And turns on his radio to his local AM station

She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.
Her passport shows a face
From another time and place
She looks nothin' like that.
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind.
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.
She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay.
As the mornin' light breaks open, the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.
""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says,
Carefully removes his fez,
""Am I hearin' you right?""
And as the yellow fog is liftin'
The Greek is quickly headin' for the second floor.
She passes him on the spiral staircase
Thinkin' he's the Soviet Ambassador,
She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
On Black Diamond Bay.
A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doin' business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,
""Can you see anything?""
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,
Says, ""Open up another deck.""
But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait,''
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay.
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.
He tried to grab the woman's hand,
Said, ""Here's a ring, it cost a grand.""
She said, ""That ain't enough.""
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.
She passed the door that the Greek had locked,
Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb.""
She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay.
""I've got to talk to someone quick!""
But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor.
He hung there from the chandelier.
She cried, ""Help, there's danger near
Please open up the door!""
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love.
But the desk clerk said, ""It happens every day,""
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay.
As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
The dealer said, ""It's too late now.
You can take your money, but I don't know how
You'll spend it in the tomb.""
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,
""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup.""
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay.
I was sittin' home alone one night in L.A.,
Watchin' old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothin' but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes.
Didn't seem like much was happenin',
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.
Seems like every time you turn around
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
And there's really nothin' anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway

I chased you thru the midnight streets
To be where I could speak freely
I didn't care what tomorrow held
I felt the world turning only for us
Only bliss now for you and me
Rise up let life's kiss send us reeling
And unlike the times before
From yesterday comes tomorrow
When life comes alive the past moves aside
No regrets and no remorse
We have more than everything
More than man or machine
More than luck
More than fiction
Higher than any religion
And unlike the times before
From yesterday comes tomorrow
When life comes alive the past moves aside
No regrets and no remorse
We'll squeeze the blood out of life
And say goodnight to the silver of old
Even when wrong we're right
Far beyond the world of diamonds and gold

Where happiness lies
I want you to know I know

And all the sorrow in this world...
Let me take you to the hurting ground
Where all good men are trampled down
Just to settle a bet that could not be won
Between a prideful father and his son
Will you guide me now, for I can't see
A reason for the suffering and this long misery
What if every living soul could be upright and strong
Well, then I do imagine...
There will be Sorrow
Yeah there will be Sorrow
And there will be Sorrow, no more
When all soldiers lay their weapons down
Or when all kings and all queens relinquish their crowns
Or when the only true messiah rescues us from ourselves

I tapped on her drum and asked her how come.

And straightened her suit,
Then she said, ""Don't get cute.""

And felt with my thumbs,
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum.

I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.

Forgotten my shirt,
I went back and knocked.
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,

That leaned up against

Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some.
She said, ""No, dear.""
I said, ""Your words aren't clear,

Put her baby in the river let the river roll on
She looked at her boy in the crib where he lay
Got down on her knees cried till she prayed
Mist was on the water low run the tide
Janey held her son down at the riverside
Waist deep in water how bright the sun shone
She lifted him in her arms and carried him home
As he lay sleeping in her bed Janey took a look around at everything
Went to a drawer in her bureau and got out her old engagement ring
Took out her wedding dress tied that ring up in its sash
Went straight down to the pawn shop man and walked out with some good
cold cash

You say love’s overrated,
I say it’s complicated.
So what am I supposed to do oh oh,
When she’s so damn cold like 20 below.
That girl, that girl she’s such a bitch,
I tell myself I can handle it.
But where am I supposed to go oh oh
When she throws me out and it’s 20 below,
That girl that girl she’s such a trick,
But I can’t lie I’m in love with it
That girl, oh, oh, oh, oh.

How about how good it feels to finally forgive you
How about grieving it all one at a time

How about not equating death with stopping

Lighting candles to make amends
For a voice
Never to speak again
Six feet under for what never should've been
Stop living like you walk on water
Looking down on all those left to drown
And you know
I couldn't find the words before
Only if I had another day left here
I'd tell you
If I had another day
To try to take away your pain
Now you're so far out of reach
It's a lesson you can't teach
You love and you lose
I wish that you know
That it's just a lesson you can't teach
I've seen the scars you've tried to hide
Searching for answers when you look to the sky
Say I'm liar, say I'm a fake
I'm far from a saint
So I'll live with my mistakes
If I'm a liar, if I'm a fake
I'll take all these sins
And you can burn me at the stake
Son of God, are you listening?
Son of God, can you hear my cry?
We put our faith into you
How could you just watch them die?

Slow and low - that is the tempo

It's never old school - all brand new
So everybody catch - the bugaloo flu
Not like a fever - not like a cold
The beats are clear - the rhymes are bold
So don't see a doctor or see a nurse
Just listen to the music - first things first
First of all - get off the wall
It's time to party so have a ball
Because we slowed it on down - so get the hell up
Like a volcano I'll erupt
We got determination - bass and highs
White Castle fries only come in one size
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen - nothing yet

(repeat chorus)

I do not sing - but I make a Def song
You could live your whole life - and I hope you live long
On the Gong Show we won't get gonged
We're the Beastie Boys - not Cheech and Chong
Strong as an ox - fresh out the box
The crowd is so live - they're coming in flocks
And when we go on - the crowd goes off
It's all hard rock - there's nothing soft
(repeat chorus)
We don't only rock the house but we'll house we rock
We don't stroll but we roll straight to the top
M.C.A., Adrock, Mike D
makes three
And we can do it like this in the place to be
When I'm recorded - you'll be rewarded
I know my song is Def 'cause you all applauded
Not P.C.P
or L.S.D
- just me Mike D
in the place to be
This is not free - you must pay a fee
Cash on delivery like a C.O.D.

The beat is slow in order to dance
I wanna hear I dos and no I can't
First you move your legs - and then your arms
It's not fast and nervous - this dance is calm
It's truly stable and you ought to be able
To dance to the record when it's on the turntable

And you ask, ""Is this where it is?""

""It's his""

And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, ""How does it feel
To be such a freak?""
And you say, ""Impossible""
As he hands you a bone
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is

Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations

And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks

It's well known

Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, ""Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan""
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word ""NOW""
And you say, ""For what reason?""
And he says, ""How?""
And you say, ""What does this mean?""
And he screams back, ""You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home""

But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones
Because something is happening here
